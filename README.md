# Spotify-Youtube-Sync
Script to add liked videos on YouTube to Spotify playlist

This will be a Python script that routinely monitors for interactions I've made with YouTube videos. Given that I have
liked a YouTube video of a song, the script will find the song through Spotify and add it to a personal playlist.
This will make use of both the YouTube and Spotify Web APIs
